-- Table Schema:
-- Table: resort_monthly_snowfall
--   resort_id: INT
--   resort_name: VARCHAR
--   snow_month: INT
--   snowfall_inches: DECIMAL

-- My Solution:

WITH annual_snowfall AS (
  SELECT resort_name, SUM(snowfall_inches) AS annual_inches
  FROM resort_monthly_snowfall
  GROUP BY resort_name
)
SELECT resort_name, annual_inches, NTILE(4) OVER(ORDER BY annual_inches) AS quartiles
FROM annual_snowfall
